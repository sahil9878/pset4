1.  To ensure portability by specifying the size of certain integer types.
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are exact-width integer types
    which have the same number of bits across all implementations.
3.  BYTE : 1 byte
    DWORD : 4 bytes
    LONG : 4 bytes
    WORD : 2 bytes
4.  BM in ASCII.
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file in bytes whereas biSize is the number of 
    bytes required by structure.
6.  Negative biHeight indicates a top-down device-independent Bitmap and 
    it's origin is the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  Insufficient memory
9.  The third argument passed to fread is 1 beacuse the program should read in 1
    RGB triple at a time.
10. (4 - ( 3 * 3) % 4) % 4 = (4 - (9 % 4) % 4) = (4 - 1) % 4 = 3
11. Whenever we're reading into a file there's a file position indicator ,
    like our cursor, that keeps track of where in file we are. So in order to move
    that cursor we use this function fseek()
    it takes three arguments as followed
    fseek ( inptr, offset, from);
(a) inptr: FILE * to seek over
(b) offset: Number of bytes to move cursor
(c) from ( the position relative to which file pointer will move) :
    SEEK_CUR (current position in file)
    SEEK_END (end of file)
    SEEK_SET (beginning of file)
    In this program, fseek skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple).

12. SEEK_CUR is the third agument passed to fseek() function which means that file pointer
    will move relative to the current position of file pointer.
